 2017 Asia and Pacific Mathematical Contest in Modeling begins at 6AM on Thursday (November 23) and ends at 9AM on Monday (November 27) in Beijing time.

    We have two contest problems (A problem and B problem). Each team may choose any one of the two problem choices, and should submit a solution to only one problem through the registration system before 9AM on Monday (November 27) in Beijing time.

     Wish all the teams get good results!
